# Security Fundamentals Portfolio

This repository showcases my **individual coursework** for the **CIS2710 â€“ Security Fundamentals (2024)** module, completed as part of my **BSc (Hons) Computing (Networks, Cyber Security & Forensics)** degree at Edge Hill University.  
It demonstrates my understanding of **ransomware threats, reconnaissance testing, and network defence techniques** using tools like **Kali Linux**, **Nmap**, and **UFW**.

## ðŸ“˜ Coursework Overview

### ðŸ§© Task 1 â€“ Ransomware Case Study
**Focus:** Analysed the 2024 **Indonesia National Data Centre ransomware attack** carried out by the *Brain Cipher* group (LockBit 3.0 variant).  

**Highlights:**
- Performed detailed threat and vulnerability analysis  
- Identified weak access control and lack of incident response  
- Proposed mitigation strategies: MFA, patch management, security awareness training  
- Evaluated the impact on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability

### ðŸ§  Tasks 2 & 3 â€“ Network Reconnaissance and Defence
**Focus:** Practical simulation of network reconnaissance and firewall defence in a **VirtualBox** lab environment.  

**Highlights:**
- Conducted footprinting and scanning using **Nmap**, **Netcat**, **Masscan**, and **Metasploit**  
- Identified open ports (FTP 21, SSH 22, HTTP 80) and associated vulnerabilities  
- Implemented **UFW firewall** rules to harden the system and mitigate risk  
- Analysed insider threats and proposed defences such as MFA, DLP, and security awareness training
